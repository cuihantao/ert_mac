{"name":"Ert mac","tagline":"Embedded realtime target for OSX operating system.","body":"### Embedded real-time target for OSX operating system.\r\n\r\nThere is already a common used target for Linux based system called ert_linux, which is hosted here: http://lintarget.sourceforge.net/\r\n\r\nSince Simulink and Matlab are running as well under MacOSX I have implemented a similar target for MAC. The big advantage for OSX based systems is the mach scheduler, which is a native real-time part of the Apple operating system.\r\n\r\nThe major changes compared to the lintarget are the absolute time retrieval and the semaphore synchronization.\r\n\r\nInside the lintarget there are several settings and code constructs which prevent the embedded coder of generating C++ code. This is now possible with the ert_mac target.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
